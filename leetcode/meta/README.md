# Meta Leetcode Questions

We will be solving Meta Leetcode problems using C++ and Python.

I am referencing [Meta's Software Engineer Initial Interview Guide](https://scontent.fsac1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/461927423_1550072192278365_8776068472137718280_n.pdf?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=e0yAPYRdm9MQ7kNvgFuIAPO&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent.fsac1-2.fna&_nc_gid=AEjNwnZ07mEd-3oEGIl5P9s&oh=00_AYCnfjHbAh4fArcXivMFFi3Et8e56LpVNfZsWVm53qCcaA&oe=67A05E7E)

I will also be getting help from Perplexity AI on solving these problems.

- For instance, to make sure that I follow Meta's best practices like "How to Approach Coding Problems During Your Interview", I will provide this structure to Perplexity AI to break down the problems for me initially.
- Once I have seen how Perplexity AI solves the problem using Meta's approach, I will later come back to the problem and solve it on my own using Meta's approach.
- I will also see if Perplexity AI can help tailor and rewrite the questions in regards to Meta Quest in Healthcare Use Cases.
