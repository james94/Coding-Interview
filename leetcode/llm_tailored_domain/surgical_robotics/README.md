# Surgical Robotics DS & Alg Problems

For our surgical robotics tailored problems based on leetcode problems, each of these leetcode problems we fed
to a LLM platform, such as Perplexity AI to instruct it to re-generate our leetcode problems into surgical robotics
ones that serve a better purpose of helping us relate them to the real world.
