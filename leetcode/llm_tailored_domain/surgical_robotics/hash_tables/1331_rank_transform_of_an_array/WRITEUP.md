# 1331. Rank Transform of an Array (Surgical Robotics) Solution

## Software Design Methodology

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a combination of sorting and hash tables. Here's the approach:

1. Create a copy of the input array and sort it in ascending order.

2. Use a hash table to map each unique precision value in its rank.

3. Iterate through the original array and replace each value with its rank from the hash table.

## Time Complexity

**Time Complexity:** O(n log n), where n is the number of precision readings. This is due to the sorting step.

## Space Complexity

**Space Complexity:** O(n) for the additional array and hash table.

## C++ Implementation

Refer to [cpp/main.cpp](./cpp/main.cpp) for C++ implementation.

## Handling Concurrency Issues

To handle concurrency in a multi-threaded environment:

1. Use thread-safe data structures or implement proper synchronization mechanisms.

2. Consider using a read-write lock for the rankMap to allow multiple threads to read simultaneously while ensuring exclusive write access.

3. Process batches or readings in parallel, then merge the results.

## Handling Real-Time Streaming Data

1.  Implement a sliding window approach to process recent data.

2. Use a priority queue (min-heap) to maintain the top N most precise movements.

3. Periodically update the ranking based on the current window of data.
