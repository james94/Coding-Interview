- Day 5: Study strategies to optimize algorithms to improve their Big-O notation.

**Data Structures**

- Day 6: Review arrays (1D, 2D, 3D) and their operations.
- Day 7: Learn about linked lists and reverse linked lists. Understand the trade-offs between space and time complexity.

### Week 2: Advanced Data Structures and Object-Oriented Design

**Advanced Data Structures**

- Day 8: Explore hash tables, focusing on collision handling techniques.
- Day 9: Study stacks and queues with practical examples.
- Day 10: Learn about heaps and their applications in priority queues.
- Day 11: Delve into binary trees, understanding traversal methods.

**Object-Oriented Design**

- Day 12-13: Understand the principles of object-oriented design (OOD). Focus on encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- Day 14: Practice designing a simple system using OOD principles.

### Week 3: Sorting, Searching, Trees, and Recursion

**Sorting and Searching**

- Day 15: Review sorting algorithms (quick sort, merge sort) and their complexities.
- Day 16: Study searching algorithms (binary search) for different data structures.

**Trees**

**Recursion**

- Day 19: Understand recursion fundamentals. Solve problems involving recursive strings.

### Week 4: Graphs and Application to Medical Robotics

**Graphs**

- Day 20: Study graph representations (adjacency list/matrix) and basic graph traversal algorithms (DFS/BFS).
- Day 21: Explore advanced topics like shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra's, A*).

**Application to Medical Robotics**

- Day 22-23: Investigate the application of semantic segmentation in medical imaging systems34. Understand how these techniques can be applied to identify anatomical structures or pathologies.
- Day 24: Study object detection methods used in surgical robotics for identifying instruments or tissues

**Integration of Knowledge**

- Day 25: Review how path planning algorithms can be used in robotic navigation within medical environments56.
- Day 26: Work on a small project or case study that integrates object detection, segmentation, and path planning in a medical robotics context.

**Review and Practice**

Day 27-28: Review all topics covered. Take mock interviews or participate in coding challenges to test your understanding.
