# Multithreaded Data Processing Pipeline (Solution)

## Before Coding

### Clarifying questions:

1. What type of NBA data are we processing in this pipeline?

2. How many threads should we use?

3. Is there a specific output format required?

4. Are there any memory or time constraints?

5. Do we need to handle rate limiting or API restrictions?

6. What's the expected input and output format?

### Potential solutions:

1. Use a producer-consumer pattern with a shared queue.

2. Implement a thread pool for managing worker threads.

3. Use asyncio for asynchronous processing

## Multithreaded Data Processing Pipeline Implementation

We'll proceed with the Producer-Consumer Pattern for multithreaded Data Processing Pipeline using a shared queue, as it's a common and efficient approach.

Python Producer-Consumer Multithreaded Data Processing Pipeline Shared Queue approach:

- [data_processor.py](./python/data_processor.py)

Python Web Crawler Data Pipeline Shared Queue approach:

- [web_crawler_data_pipeline.py](./python/web_crawler_data_pipeline.py)

## While Coding

### 1. **Data Structures and Algorithms**:

- Queue for thread-safe data sharing
- List for storing results
- Threading for concurrent processing

### 2. **Big-O Notation**:

- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of data items
- Space Complexity: O(n) for storing input data and results

### Main Function NBA Players Performance Stats

## After Coding

### Multithreaded Data Pipeline Shared Queue Approach: Potential Improvements

1. Implement error handling and logging for robustness

2. Add batching to reduce lock contention

3. Use a thread pool for more efficient thread management

4. Implement priority queue for processing important data first

5. Add progress tracking and reporting

This solution demonstrates a multithreaded data processing pipeline for NBA player data.
It uses a producer-consumer pattern with a shared queue, allowing for concurrent
processing of player information. The main() function shows how to use the DataProcessor
class with a sample set of NBA player data.

### Multithreaded Web Crawler Shared Queue Approach: Potential Improvements

1. Implement proper error handling and logging

2. Add rate limiting to respect NBA website's policies

3. Use a thread pool for more efficient thread management

4. Implement depth limiting to control the crawl scope

5. Add data validation and cleaning for extracted player information

6. Implement a more robust parsing method for player statistics

7. Add support for saving results to a database or file

8. Implement resume capability for interrupted crawls
