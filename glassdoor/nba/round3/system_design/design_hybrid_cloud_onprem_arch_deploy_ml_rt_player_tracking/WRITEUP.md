# Design Hybrid Cloud/On-Premise Architecture for ML Real-Time Player Tracking

We'll design a hybrid cloud/on-premises architecture for deploying machine learning
models at scale for real-time player tracking using the Exponent System Design Interview Guide
approach.

## Step 1: Understand the Problem

### **Functional Requirements**

- Real-time player tracking using machine learning models
- High-throughput, low-latency data processing
- Hybrid cloud/on-premises architecture
- Scalable deployment of ML models
- Integration with existing NBA data and software systems
- Supports for automated officiating initiatives

### **Non-Functional Requirements**

- Low latency for real-time processing
- High availability and fault tolerance
- Scalability to handle multiple games simultaneously
- Data security and privacy compliance

### **Clients and Consumers**

- NBA teams, coaches, and analysts
- Broadcasters and media partners
- Fans and viewers
- Officiating systems

## Step 2: Design the System

### API Design

We'll use REST APIs for communication between components:

1. Player Tracking API:

~~~bash
POST /track-players
~~~

- Request: Game ID, video feed URL
- Response: JSON with player positions, movements, and stats

2. Model Management API:

~~~bash
GET /models

POST /models

PUT /models/{model_id}

DELETE /models/{model_id}
~~~

3. Statistics API:

~~~bash
GET /stats/game/{game_id}

GET /stats/player/{player_id}

GET /stats/team/{team_id}
~~~

## Step 3: Dive Deep

### version 2 ML tailored: Data Processing & Model Serving

The **Data Processing** and **Model Serving** components are crucial for real-time player tracking:

1. **Data Ingestion:**

- Use Apache Kafka for high-throughput, low-latency data streaming from on-premises systems to the cloud.
- Implement Kafka Connect for seamless integration with other systems.

2. **Data Processing:**

- Utilize Apache Flink for real-time stream processing of player tracking data.
- Implement custom operators in Python or Java for complex data transformations.

3. **Model Serving:**

- Deploy models using KubeFlow or MLflow for model versioning and management.
- Implement A/B testing for model deployment using lstio service mesh.
- Utilize GPU acceleration for faster inference on computer vision models.
