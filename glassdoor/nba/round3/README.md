# Round 3: Interview with Head of Infrastructure Software Engineering

This round will combine technical, domain-specific questions, and system design:

- **System Design**: Design a hybrid cloud/on-premises architecture for deploying machine learning models at scale for real-time player tracking.
- **LeetCode-style question**: Implement a multithreaded data processing pipeline (Hard difficulty, similar to “Web Crawler Multithreaded”).
- Explain your approach to API design and management for a developer-facing platform.
- How would you ensure low-latency data processing in a distributed system?
