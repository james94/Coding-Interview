# NBA Game Outcome Prediction: PCA and Classifier Pipeline

## Problem Statement

Create a machine learning pipeline that combines Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
with a classifier to predict NBA game outcomes based on high-dimensional player
tracking data. The pipeline should reduce the dimensionality of the input data while
maintaining predictive power.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:**

~~~yml
Player Tracking Data: [Distance Traveled: 2.5 miles, Avg Speed: 4.2 mph, Touches: 65, Passes: 52, ...]

Additional Features: [Home/Away, Days Rest, Previous Game Result]
~~~

**Output:**

~~~yml
Predicted Outcome: Win (65% probability)
~~~

**Explanation:**

PCA reduces the high-dimensional tracking data, and the classifier predicts a win based on the principal components and additional features.

### Example 2

**Input:**

~~~yml
Player Tracking Data: [Distance Traveled: 2.1 miles, Avg Speed: 3.8 mph, Touches: 45, Passes: 38, ...]

Additional Features: [Home/Away, Days Rest, Previous Game Result]
~~~

**Output:**

~~~yml
Predicted Outcome: Loss (58% probability)
~~~

**Explanation:**

Lower player activity metrics contribute to a predicted loss after PCA reduction and classification.

### Example 3

**Input:**

~~~yml
Player Tracking Data: [Distance Traveled: 2.7 miles, Avg Speed: 4.5 mph, Touches: 72, Passes: 60, ...]

Additional Features: [Home/Away, Days Rest, Previous Game Result]
~~~

**Output:**

~~~yml
Predicted Outcome: Win (78% probability)
~~~

**Explanation:**

High player engagement metrics lead to a strong win prediction after dimensionality reduction and classification.


## Constraints


- Input Features: 50-200 player tracking metrics per team
- Additional Features: 3-5 game context features
- Number of Principal Components: 10-20
- Training Data Size: 500-1000 games
- Prediction Target: Binary (Win/Loss)

## Follow-Up

1. How would you handle time-series aspects of player performance in your model?

2. Can you modify the pipeline to interpret which original features contribute most to the predictions?

3. What techniques would you use to handle class imbalance in game outcomes?

The implementation draws insights from the search results, particularly the research showing:

- The use of PCA for dimensionality reduction in sports analytics
- The effectiveness of machine learning models like XGBoost in predicting NBA game outcomes
- The application of PCA to player tracking data for team comparisons
