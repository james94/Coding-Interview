# Temporal Segmentation for NBA Game Play Categorization

## Problem Statement

Design a temporal segmentation approach using PyTorch to automatically clip and 
categorize different types of plays from full NBA game footage. The model should 
process video sequences and identify distinct play segments, classifying them into 
categories such as fast breaks, pick-and-rolls, isolation plays, etc.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:**

~~~yml
Input: 10-minute video segment of NBA game footage (1080p, 30 fps)
~~~

**Output:**

~~~yml
Clip 1: [start_time: 0:15, end_time: 0:28, category: "Fast Break", confidence: 0.92]
Clip 2: [start_time: 1:05, end_time: 1:22, category: "Pick and Roll", confidence: 0.87]
~~~

**Explanation:**

The model identifies two distinct plays, segmenting and categorizing them from the continuous game footage.


### Example 2

**Input:**

~~~yml
Input: 5-minute video segment of NBA game footage (720p, 60 fps)
~~~

**Output:**

~~~yml
Clip 1: [start_time: 0:45, end_time: 1:02, category: "Isolation", confidence: 0.89]
Clip 2: [start_time: 2:18, end_time: 2:35, category: "Post-up", confidence: 0.85]
Clip 3: [start_time: 4:02, end_time: 4:20, category: "Off-ball Screen", confidence: 0.81]
~~~

**Explanation:**

The model segments three different play types from the input footage, providing start and end times for each.

## Constraints


- Input: Video segments of varying length (1-10 minutes)
- Output: List of play clips with start/end times and categories
- Model Architecture: CNN (ResNet) + LSTM for temporal modeling
- Minimum Clip Duration: 5 seconds
- Maximum Clip Duration: 30 seconds
- Play Categories: 5-10 distinct play types

## Follow-Up

1. How would you handle transitions between plays and non-play segments (e.g., timeouts, free throws)?

2. Can you modify the model to provide real-time play classification during live game broadcasts?

3. What techniques would you use to ensure the model generalizes well across different teams and playing styles?

This implementation draws insights from the search results, particularly:

- The use of deep learning and temporal segmentation for basketball video analysis12
- The combination of CNN and RNN architectures for processing video sequences3
- The importance of considering camera movements and player actions in segmentatio
