# Design Scalable ETL Architecture for Low-Latency Stats NBA Data

We'll design a scalable architecture for ingesting and processing high-volume, low-latency statistical data from multiple NBA games simultaneously using the provided System Design Interview Guide, while addressing key requirements of the
NBA Software Engineer, Machine Learning position.

## Step 1: Understand the Problem

### **Functional Requirements**

- Ingest real-time statistical data from multiple NBA games
- Process and store the ingested data with low latency
- Support data science and machine learning operations
- Provide PAIs for fan-facing products and automated officiating initiatives
- Provide low-latency access to processed data

**Non-Functional Requirements**:

- High throughput and low latency
- Scalability to handle multiple games simultaneously
- High availability, reliability and fault tolerance
- Support for both cloud and on-premises deployments

**Clients and Consumers**:

- NBA data analysts
- Media partners
- Mobile apps and websites
- Fantasy basketball platforms

## Step 2: Design the System

### API Design

We'll use REST APIs for data ingestion and retrieval:

1. Data Ingestion API:

~~~bash
POST /api/v1/games/{gameId}/stats
~~~

- Parameters: gameId (path), statPayload (body)
- Response: 200 OK, 400 Bad Request

2. Data Retrieval API:

~~~bash
GET /api/v1/games/{gameId}/stats
~~~

- Parameters: gameId (path), timestamp (query, optional)
- Response: 200 OK with JSON payload, 404 Not Found

**Components**

- 1. **Data Sources**: NBA arenas with sensors and data collection systems
- 2. **Load Balancer**: Distributes incoming data across multiple ingestion servers
- 3. **Ingestion Servers**: Receive and validate incoming data
- 4. **Message Queue**: (ex: Apache Kafka): Buffers incoming data for processing
- 5. **Processing Servers**: Consume data from the queue, process it, and store in the database
- 6. **Database Clusters**: Stores processed data (ex: Apache Cassandra for time-series data)
- **Clients**: Refer to some client examples in **Step 1**.
- 7. **Read Replicas**: Provide fast read access to data
- 8. **Caching Layers**: (ex: Redis): Caches frequently accessed data
- 9. **API Servers**: Handle client requests for data retrieval

## Step 3: Dive Deep

### version 2 ML tailored

We'll focus on the Stream Processing component, which aligns with the job requirement of developing
high-throughput, low-latency data processing systems:

#### Stream Processing (Apache Flink)

- Consumes data from ingestion servers in real-time
- Performs data cleansing and normalization
- Calculates real-time statistics (ex: points, rebounds, assists)
- Aggregates data for different time windows (quarter, game, season)
- Triggers alerts for exceptional events or milestones
- Feeds processed data to the database clusters and ML model serving component

This component addresses the following **job responsibilities**:

- Developing high-throughput, low-latency data processing systems
- Establishing scalable workflows for processing complex data from multiple games in real-time
- Contributing to data science infrastructure for generating insights from player tracking data

### version 1

We'll focus on the Ingestion Servers and Processing Servers:

#### Ingestion Servers

- Validate incoming data format and integrity
- Compress data if needed
- Partition data by game ID and timestamp
- Push data to appropriate Kafka topics

#### Processing Servers

- Consume data from Kafka topics
- Aggregate statistics (ex: points per quarter, shooting percentages)
- Calculate derived metrics (ex: player efficiency ratings)
- Store processed data in the database cluster
- Update caches for fast retrieval

## Step 4: Refine the Design

### version 2 ML tailored

Addressing potential bottlenecks and job requirements:

1. **Scalability:**

- Use Kubernetes for container orchestration, allowing easy scaling of all components
- Implement auto-scaling based on load for ingestion and processing servers

- Use MLflow for model versioning and deployment
- Integrate computer vision models for automated officiating initiatives

4. **API Management:**

- Implement API gateway (ex: Kong) for security, analytics and developer management
- Design APIs for both internal use and fan-facing products

5. **Data Science Support:**

- Implement a data lake (ex: Data Lake) for historical data storage and analysis
- Provide Jupyter Notebook integration for data scientists to explore and analyze data

### version 1

Addressing potential bottlenecks:

1. **Single Points of Failure:**

- Use multiple load balancers with failover mechanisms
- Implement redundancy for all components

2. **Data Replication:**

- Replicate data across multiple database nodes
- Use multi-region replication for disaster recovery

3. **CDNs:**

- Implement a CDN for serving static content and cached data to global users

4. **High Traffic:**

- Auto-scale ingestion and processing servers based on load
- Use database sharding for improved write performance

5. **Scalability:**

- Horizontally scale all components
- Use microservices architecture for easier scaling of individual components
