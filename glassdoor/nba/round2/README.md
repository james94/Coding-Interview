# Round 2: Interview with Data Science Engineer 

This round will combine technical, domain-specific questions, and system design:

- Explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning.
- **System Design**: Design a scalable architecture for ingesting and processing high-volume, low-latency statistical data from multiple NBA games simultaneously.
- **LeetCode-style question**: Implement a k-means clustering algorithm from scratch (Medium difficulty).
- How would you approach feature selection for a model predicting player performance?
