# Develop a Database from Scratch (Financial Operations) Solution

## Software Design

To develop a database from scratch for a financial operations platform combining corporate cards, expense management, bill payments, vendor management, and accounting automation, we'll implement a C++ solution that addresses the core functionality while considering scalability and performance.

You'll see our implementation provides a basic framework for a key-value database with TTL (Time-To-Live) functionality, which is crucial for managing time-sensitive financial data, such as transaction records or temporary authorizations.

Key aspects of this design and implementation to address Ramp's Software Engineer | Backend role:

1. **Scalable Systems:**

2. **Financial Technology:**

3. **Data Structure and Algorithms:**

4. **Distributed Systems:**

5. **Performance Optimization:**

6. **API Design:**

7. **Real-Time Systems:** TTL Implementation

8. **Prefix Search:**

9. **Time Complexity:**

10. **Space Complexity:**

## Future Improvements to Full-Stack Financial Operations Platform

1. Implement transaction logging for audit trails.

2. Add indexing for faster searches on frequently queried fields.

3. Implement data partitioning for better scalability.

4. Add support for complex queries and aggregations for financial reporting.

5. Implement a caching layer for frequently accessed data.

6. Add support for concurrent access and ACID transactions.
