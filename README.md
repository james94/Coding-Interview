## Leetcode Problems Tailored to Domains

To avoid solving Leetcode toy problems for the sake of just preparing for technical interviews, we work with GPTs, such as Perplexity AI to re-generate Leetcode questions from Data Structures & Algorithms into problems tailored for particular domains, such as:

## **[Medical Imaging](./leetcode/llm_tailored_domain/medical_imaging/README.md)**
