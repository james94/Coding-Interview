## Leetcode Problems Tailored to Domains

To avoid solving Leetcode toy problems for the sake of just preparing for technical interviews, we work with GPTs, such as Perplexity AI to re-generate Leetcode questions from Data Structures & Algorithms into problems tailored for particular domains, such as:

- **[Medical Imaging](./leetcode/llm_tailored_domain/medical_imaging/README.md)**

- **Self-Driving Cars**

- **Unmanned Aircraft Systems**

- **[Surgical Robotics](./leetcode/llm_tailored_domain/surgical_robotics/README.md)**
